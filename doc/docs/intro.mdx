- ðŸ”Œ Pluggable/Extensible
- ðŸ”– Design System ready

## In few lines

Former is a form library that aims to make the writing of forms on React easy like writing them directly
on the HTML.

To do it Former let each input to be just declared and enhance the [Single
Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle)
of each element (each input field take care just of it self).

The SRP let each field to render independently without causing unhandled re-render side effects.

The main `<Form />` component is the **only** interface for managing user set data, this choice in order to
lead to a better forms develop and managing all the data in a single place.

By the nature of Former this library is useful for sharing a components in a desing systems that includes also the
inputs elements.

## Why a new form library?

Currently implementations are quite verbose causing a confusing DX and in
some case they use uncontrolled components which is the
[unrecommended](https://reactjs.org/docs/uncontrolled-components.html)
way to handle forms in React.

In most cases using uncontrolled components causes re-renders in unexpected
actions like the submit (?).

Among the other reasons Former wants to let the developer to write forms in the
better React way possible handling the re-renders in a declarative way.

## How hard is writing Former's forms?

In short... easy like a pie.

<TabItem value="typescript" label="Typescript">

```tsx
import { FormEvent } from 'react'
import { Form, Input, Value } from 'form-er'

function App(): JSX.Element {
  return (
    <Form onSubmit={submit}>
      <Input name="email" type="email" initialValue="" />
      <Input name="password" type="password" initialValue="" />
      <Input name="terms-acceptance" type="checkbox" initialValue={true} />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </Form>
  )
}
```

<TabItem value="javascript" label="Javascript">

```jsx
import { Form, Input } from 'form-er'

function App() {
  return (
    <Form onSubmit={submit}>
      <Input name="email" type="email" initialValue="" />
      <Input name="password" type="password" initialValue="" />
      <Input name="terms-acceptance" type="checkbox" initialValue={true} />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </Form>
  )
}
```

## Key concept

In order to make Former efficient and reusable the entire state logic is managed
within the `<Form />` component (you don't need to directly control each input value).

Each Former action element (`<Input />`, `<Textarea />`, ...) has two mandatory fields:

- name (string describing the input purpose; check possible name conflicts!)
- initialValue (That's it)

Thanks to them the `<Form />` is now able to easily handle the internal state, but how?

`<Form />` is "**just**" a simple html `<form>`, so you can use it as usual. The most important
difference is that the `onSubmit` event now has two function arguments: the "classic" event and an object
which is the `name:value` representation of its content.
