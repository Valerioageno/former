## In few lines

Kingpin is a form library that aims to make the writing of forms on React easy like writing them directly
on a HTML file.

To do it Kingpin lets each input to be just declared and forces it to follow the [Single
Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle)
of each element (each input field take care just of it self).

The SRP lets each field to render independently without causing unhandled re-render side effects.

The main `<Form />` component is the **only** interface for managing user set data, this choice in order to
lead to a better forms develop and managing all the data in a single place (each state could be listened with the
still available `onChange` element event).

Read more in the [documentation](https://kingpin-react-form.vercel.app/docs/intro).

## Why a new form library?

Currently implementations are quite verbose causing a confusing DX.

Also there are many way to think about forms implementations:

- Using `new FormData` with the plain HTML validation systems ([ref](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/input#reading-the-input-values-when-submitting-a-form))
- Using `useRef` to handle the data on submit.
- Using `useState` for each field causing multiple re-renders and low performances
  but a very deep level of interaction with the data.

Kingpin wants to take the best from each of them ensuring a strong development experience
but providing top performances and the deepest level of interaction.

Also Kingpin wants to be (and it is) lightweight and tree-shakable.

## How hard is writing Kingpin's forms?

In short... easy like a pie.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="typescript" label="Typescript">

```tsx
import { Form, FormResult, Input } from 'kingpin-react-form'
import { FormEvent } from 'react'

function App(): JSX.Element {
  const submit = (e: FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>, form: FormResult) => {
    e.preventDefault()
    console.log(form)

    // form: {
    //     isValid: true,
    //     payload: {
    //       email: "",
    //       password: "",
    //       terms-acceptance: true
    //     }
    // }
  }

  return (
    <Form onSubmit={submit}>
      <Input name="email" type="email" initialValue="" />
      <Input name="password" type="password" initialValue="" />
      <Input name="terms-acceptance" type="checkbox" initialValue={true} />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </Form>
  )
}
```

      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </Form>
  )
}
```

## Key concept

In order to make Kingpin efficient and reusable the entire state logic is managed
within the `<Form />` component (you shouldn't directly control each input value).

Each Kingpin action element (`<Input />`, `<Textarea />`, ...) has two mandatory fields:

- name (string describing the input purpose; be aware of possible name conflicts!)
- initialValue (That's it)

Thanks to them the `<Form />` is now able to easily handle the internal state, but how?

`<Form />` is "**just**" a simple html `<form>`, so you can use it as usual. The most significant
difference is that the `onSubmit` callback now takes two arguments: the "classic"
[event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubmitEvent) and an object
which contains whether the form is valid or not ([here](validation)
about validation) and `payload` which is the `name:value` representation of its content.
