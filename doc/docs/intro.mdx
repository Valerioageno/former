## In few lines

Kingpin is a form library that aims to make the writing of forms on React easy like writing them directly
on a HTML file.

To do it Kingpin lets each input to be just declared and forces it to follow the [Single
Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle)
of each element (each input field take care just of it self).

The SRP lets each field to render independently without causing unhandled re-render side effects.

The main `<Form />` component is the **only** interface for managing user set data, this choice in order to
lead to a better forms develop and managing all the data in a single place (each state could be listened with the
still available `onChange` element event).

Read more in the [documentation](https://kingpin-react-form.vercel.app/docs/intro).

## Why a new form library?

Current form libraries are too verbose causing a confusing development experience.
They are also frequently very heavy and this is bad under many perspectives.

> The main Kingpin purpose is to create a production ready library with a great
development experience and a very little overhead.

That's basically it but there is another thing that require a new form library.

Currently there are many ways to think about forms implementations:

- Using `new FormData` with the plain HTML validation systems ([ref](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/input#reading-the-input-values-when-submitting-a-form)) (Hard to manage)
- Using `useRef` to handle the data on submit. (Easy to use but difficult to manage atomic errors)
- Using `useState` on each field. (Super easy to use but causing very low performances)

Kingpin wants to take the best from each of them ensuring a strong development experience
but providing top performances and the most atomic level of interaction.

## How hard is writing Kingpin's forms?

In short... easy like a pie.

<TabItem value="typescript" label="Typescript">

```tsx
import { Error, Form, FormResult, Input } from 'kingpin-react-form'
import { FormEvent } from 'react'

function App(): JSX.Element {
  const submit = (e: FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>, form: FormResult) => {
    e.preventDefault()
    console.log(data)

    // data: {
    //     isValid: true,

  )
}
```

## Key concept

In order to make Kingpin efficient and reusable the entire state logic is managed
within the `<Form />` component (you shouldn't directly control each input value).

Each Kingpin action element (`<Input />`, `<Textarea />`, ...) needs a `name` prop in order
to efficiently collect the result payload. The name should describe the
input purpose; be aware of possible name conflicts!

Thanks to it the `<Form />` is now able to easily handle the internal state, but how?

`<Form />` is "**just**" a simple html `<form>`, so you can use it as usual. The most significant
difference is that the `onSubmit` callback now takes two arguments: the "classic"
[event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubmitEvent) and an object
which contains whether the form is valid or not ([here](validation)
about validation) and `payload` which is the `name:value` representation of its content.

## Why the name "Kingpin"?

Kingpin is “JUST” a bolt in a skateboard truck but is where the entire steering mechanism rely on.
Since its importance it's often very well engineer by truck companies with also many variants.

That's exactly what *kingpin-react-form* is: a super simple component, 
good engineered that allows your website to get the right direction.
