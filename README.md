## In few lines

Kingpin is a form library that aims to make the writing of forms on React easy like writing them directly
on a HTML file.

To do it Kingpin lets each input to be just declared and forces it to follow the [Single
Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle)
of each element (each input field take care just of it self).

The SRP lets each field to render independently without causing unhandled re-render side effects.

The main `<Form />` component is the **only** interface for managing user set data, this choice in order to
lead to a better forms develop and managing all the data in a single place (each state could be listened with the
still available `onChange` element event).

Read more in the [documentation](https://kingpin-react-form.vercel.app/docs/intro).

## Getting started

Install the package with your favourite package manager.

```bash
npm i kingpin-react-form
```

```bash
yarn add kingpin-react-form
```

Then create your form.

```tsx
import { Error, Form, FormResult, Input } from 'kingpin-react-form'
import { FormEvent } from 'react'

function App(): JSX.Element {
  const submit = (e: FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>, form: FormResult) => {
    e.preventDefault()
    console.log(data)

    // data: {
    //     isValid: true,
    //     payload: {
    //       email: "",
    //       password: "",
    //       terms-acceptance: true
    //     }
    // }
  }

  return (
    <Form onSubmit={submit}>
      <Input name="email" type="email" />
      <Error name="email:error">The email doesn't exist</Error>
      <Input name="password" type="password" />
      <Error name="password:error">The password is wrong</Error>
      <Input name="terms-acceptance" type="checkbox" initialValue={true} />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </Form>
  )
}
```

Easy like a pie. Check how to handle errors in the [documentation](https://kingpin-react-form.vercel.app/docs/validation)

## Key concept

In order to make Kingpin efficient and reusable the entire state logic is managed
within the `<Form />` component (you shouldn't directly control each input value).

Each Kingpin action element (`<Input />`, `<Textarea />`, ...) needs a `name` prop in order
to efficiently collect the result payload. The name should describe the
input purpose; be aware of possible name conflicts!

Thanks to it the `<Form />` is now able to easily handle the internal state, but how?

`<Form />` is "**just**" a simple html `<form>`, so you can use it as usual. The most significant
difference is that the `onSubmit` callback now takes two arguments: the "classic"
[event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubmitEvent) and an object
which contains whether the form is valid or not ([here](https://kingpin-react-form.vercel.app/docs/validation)
about validation) and `payload` which is the `name:value` representation of its content.

## Extend Kingpin inputs

Modern forms require more than just `<input />` and `<textarea />` components.

Kingpin plan is to add pluggable external components like `Typeaheads`, `Slider`, `Dropdown` ecc.
specifically desinged and developed to work within a Kingpin `Form`.

In order to make Kingpin extensible by anyone it's possible create custom
components with the `withKingpin` HOC.

To see how it works with a real example check the [documentation](https://kingpin-react-form.vercel.app/docs/withFormer).

## Contributing

First off, thank you if you will consider to contribute to kingpin-react-form.

There are many ways to contribute like implementing a new feature, fixing bugs, improving the test suite or
refining the documentation with fixes or examples.

The main kingpin's purpose is to be lightweight, full of functionalities and easy to work with. Be
sure to follow this guidelines when you will do your implementation.
